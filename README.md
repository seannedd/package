# A few choice files demonstrated the coding ability of Dr. Sean A. Nedd
# The work is based on efforts for Post-doc, Ph.D., and  M.S.
# The codes represent:
# G3MP2 and the general composite methodolgy in GAMESS (g3mp2.src, comp.src)
# addition of basis sets to GAMESS (basg3l.src)
# Interface between ReaxFF and GAMESS, including the SIMOMM code in GAMESS (rx*.src)
# The usage of the G2/97 test set into GAMESS (testset)
# Simplifying the running of the QMDMD method (QMDMDconfigure)
# Extraction of data from QMDMD runs (getdata.pl, makeqmdmdplots.sh, qmdmdplots.pl)
# Rotation about a chemical bond (rotate.f)
